# 3D Rotating Cube - THREE.js
- This THREE.js starter page which features a 3D cube (neon green) rotating around. 
- You can use this as a good starting point for another object for any splash screens, loading screens, or even more elaborate things like your own web game.
- I generated this with GPT, fixed some bugs, and used this as the basis for other object animations. I hope this code can help someone as it's an easy to understand single-page example.
